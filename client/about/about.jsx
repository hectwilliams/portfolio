            Hectors‚Äôs never been one to brag, which is why he hated creating this webpage. Lacking vain and more of an observer, Hector is more of a people person, not a person in need :). Welp let's get on with it, right...
          </p>

          <br/>

          <p>
           Hector has 6 years experience as an Electrical/Embedded Engineer where  he worked in different industries: research, manufacturing, and start-up. That is a lot to pack in 6 years, and for Hector he was always trying to find the best environment for growth and technical depth. Hector has always been a driver wherever he has landed and always pushed the status quo trying to get into new technologies. Who was the one who said ‚Äúanyone who has never made a mistake has never friend anything new‚Äù. Hector is fierce and always learning.
          </p>

          <br/>

          <p>
            Hector currently spends time building his GitHub page improving coding skills daily because Hector understands the nature of technology, it‚Äôs always in constant flux spawning into something new every decade. One thing that is most important is the ability to code, and that is what Hector loves to do. Better stated, he loves solving problems, and solving problems by finding a programmable solver is important, is the present, and is the future.
